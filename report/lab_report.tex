\section{Problem 1}
Matches $\hat{x}(t) = \cos(2\pi440t) - \sin(2\pi660t)$ sampled at $t = nT_s$, i.e. $\hat{x}[n] \coloneqq \hat{x}(nT_s)$. By a similar transformation, we can recover the time-domain equaivalent of the signal, showing as scaled deltas. This is one part of the internals in \texttt{sound} function in matlab. The sound can be played here: give github repo/online host.

\section{Problem 7}
Violin has 440 as the fundamental harmonic and has 2 sub harmonics and all above; structure to the spread. Voice has two main harmonics 440 and 220 and they reduce in magnitude, without much "structure". Shows different timbre (or lack of, thereof).
